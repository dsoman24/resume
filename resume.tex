\sectitle{Work Experience}

    \begin{experience}{Google}{Sunnyvale, CA}{STEP Intern}{May -- August 2023}
        \item Built and tested an efficient parallel-processing data aggregation pipeline using FlumeJava, a MapReduce framework, to extract over 50 useful web-domain level signals from raw HTML content of over 500 billion web pages.
        \item Designed and implemented a novel scalable and extensible data aggregation pipeline architecture which reduced signal implementation time by 50\% and eliminated boilerplate code.
        \item Extracted signals are used by Google Workspace's Growth \& Revenue Optimization team's machine learning models, utilized for predicting account upgrade, downgrade, and cancellation behaviors.
        % \item Engineered X new ML features that improved model performance by Y\%
        % \item Something about topic modeling and Latent Semantic Analysis, if implemented
    \end{experience}

    \begin{experience}{Georgia Tech College of Computing}{Atlanta, GA}{Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (Homework Lead)}{August 2022 -- Present}
        \item Manage a team of 40 TAs in the development and grading of 12 homework assignments per semester for $\sim$700 students as TA Homework Lead for CS 1331: Intro to Object-Oriented Programming, under Prof.~Richard Landry and Dr.~Aibek Musaev.
        \item Lead weekly recitations for 50 students and help students with problem-solving and debugging during one-on-one office hours.
        \item Grade 4 exams per semester and write auto-grader unit tests for assignments using the Java Reflections library.
    \end{experience}

    \begin{experience}{Ermi}{Atlanta, GA}{Engineering Intern}{July -- August 2021}
        \item Analyzed data and created decision trees from health insurance claims data from over 1k knee surgery patients using R.
        \item Identified the highest cost patients to target for non-surgical intervention.
    \end{experience}
    \begin{subexperience}{Engineering Intern}{July -- August 2019}
        \item Analyzed 10k+ data points from a robot that diagnoses knee injuries, with analysis to be incorporated into research papers.
        \item Learned and used R to organize and visualize datasets in over 40 plots to assess the reliability and accuracy of the robot.
    \end{subexperience}

    \begin{experience}{Georgia Tech Research Institute}{Atlanta, GA}{Research Intern}{June -- July 2020}
        \item Worked in a team of 4 to develop an app that creates a Bluetooth mesh network for emergency communication.
        \item Implemented routing algorithms in Python and Java and ran simulations of the app to investigate network properties and stability.
    \end{experience}

\sectitle{Leadership and Involvement}

    \begin{experience}{Georgia Tech Financial Services and Innovation Lab}{Atlanta, GA}{Undergraduate Researcher}{January -- May 2023}
        \item Led a team of 4 researchers in performing sentiment analysis on earnings calls (EC) transcripts on 12 electric vehicle (EV) companies using the natural language processing model FinBERT and library NLTK.
        \item Developed a custom web scraper using Beautiful Soup to extract over 70 EC transcripts from The Motley Fool.
        \item Created dynamic visualizations from analyzed text data to conclude that 5 major US government policies drove spikes in positive sentiment in ECs from companies that focus on EV production.
