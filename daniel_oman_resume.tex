\sectitle{Experience}

    \begin{experience}{Google}{Kirkland, WA}{Software Engineering Intern}{May 2024 -- August 2024}
        \item Designed and implemented a custom distributed load testing framework using C++ and Python to benchmark the scalability of the streaming metadata change-log service within Google BigQuery's core storage infrastructure.
        \item Built continuous test runs as a development workflow, leading to 70\% reduction in regressions before reaching production.
        \item Developed load sampling architecture to overload production traffic by sending 10k+ requests per second to the read and write RPC endpoints on a variable number of BigQuery tables, exposing production bottlenecks.
        \item Designed a multi-threaded metric sampling system with C++ to compute, aggregate, and analyze latency, throughput, and error rate metrics across 25+ load sampler instances concurrently over multiple machines, yielding increased benchmark accuracy.
        \item Fixed a critical service-level objective bug affecting BigQuery's storage metadata server by implementing request retry logic, eliminating the number of error spikes by $\sim$90\%.
    \end{experience}

    \begin{experience}{Georgia Tech Efficient and Intelligent Computing Lab}{Atlanta, GA}{Undergraduate Research Assistant}{January -- May 2024}
        \item Contributed to a PyTorch toolkit used to train distributed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for applications with multiple large disjoint graphs, such as electronic design analysis and molecular modeling.
        \item Built a user-friendly modular data loading and transfer API and implemented the GraphSAGE GNN forward propagation and graph vertex embedding algorithm, improving model accuracies by an average of 15\%.
    \end{experience}

    \begin{experience}{Georgia Tech College of Computing}{Atlanta, GA}{Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (Homework Lead)}{August 2022 -- May 2024}
        \item Managed a team of 40 TAs in the development and grading of 12 homework assignments for over 800 students per semester as TA Homework Lead for CS 1331: Intro to Object-Oriented Programming (Java) under Prof.~Richard Landry and Dr.~Aibek Musaev.
        \item Led weekly recitations for 50 students and helped students with problem-solving and debugging during one-on-one office hours.
    \end{experience}

    \begin{experience}{Google}{Sunnyvale, CA}{STEP Intern}{May -- August 2023}
        \item Designed, implemented, and tested an efficient parallel-processing data pipeline being used in production to provide features to train machine learning models that predict Google Workspace account upgrade, downgrade, and churn behaviors.
        \item Built pipeline using FlumeJava, a Java MapReduce framework, to extract and aggregate 70+ web domain level ML features from a database containing the HTML of more than 500 billion web pages, increasing customer coverage in the feature store by 20\%.
        \item Engineered a scalable and extensible data aggregation architecture by applying advanced OOP design patterns that reduced feature implementation time by over 50\% and provided an intuitive interface for future feature store contributions.
        \item Refactored pipeline to improve reliability by developing a system to flush intermediate output to a Spanner database across 10k+ processes during a full table scan, preventing up to 7 days worth of lost data for each pipeline run.
    \end{experience}
