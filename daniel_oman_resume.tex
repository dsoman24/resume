\sectitle{Experience}

    \begin{experience}{Google}{Sunnyvale, CA}{STEP Intern}{May -- August 2023}
        \item Implemented and tested an efficient parallel-processing data pipeline being used in production to train machine learning models that predict Google Workspace account upgrade, downgrade, and churn behaviors.
        \item Built pipeline using FlumeJava, a Java MapReduce framework, to extract and aggregate 70+ web domain level ML features from a database containing the HTML of more than 500 billion web pages, increasing customer coverage in the feature store by 20\%.
        \item Designed and implemented a scalable and extensible data aggregation architecture by applying advanced OOP design patterns that reduced feature implementation time by over 50\% and provided an intuitive interface for future feature store contributions.
        \item Refactored pipeline to improve reliability by developing a system to flush intermediate output to disk across 100k+ threads during a full table scan, preventing data loss by storing more than 7 days of data progress during each pipeline execution.
    \end{experience}

    \begin{experience}{Georgia Tech Financial Services and Innovation Lab}{Atlanta, GA}{Undergraduate Researcher (Subteam Lead)}{January -- May 2023}
        \item Led a team of 4 researchers in performing sentiment analysis on earnings calls transcripts on 12 electric vehicle companies using the large language model FinBERT and natural language processing library NLTK.
        \item Developed a custom web scraper using Beautiful Soup to extract over 70 earnings call transcripts from The Motley Fool.
        \item Created dynamic visualizations from analyzed text data to conclude that 5 major US government policies drove spikes in positive sentiment in earning calls from companies that focus on electric vehicle production.
    \end{experience}

    \begin{experience}{Georgia Tech College of Computing}{Atlanta, GA}{Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (Homework Lead)}{August 2022 -- Present}
        \item Manage a team of 40 TAs in the development and grading of 12 homework assignments per semester for over 800 students as TA Homework Lead for CS 1331: Intro to Object-Oriented Programming under Prof.~Richard Landry and Dr.~Aibek Musaev.
        \item Lead weekly recitations for 50 students and help students with problem-solving and debugging during one-on-one office hours.
        \item Grade 4 exams per semester and write auto-grader unit tests for assignments using the Java Reflections library.
    \end{experience}

    \begin{experience}{Ermi}{Atlanta, GA}{Engineering Intern}{July -- August 2019, July -- August 2021}
        \item Analyzed data and created decision trees from health insurance claims data from over 1000 knee surgery patients using R, identifying the highest cost patients to target for non-surgical intervention.
        \item Wrote R scripts to analyze 10k+ data points from a robot that diagnoses knee injuries to assess and visualize its reliability and accuracy, with analysis to be incorporated into research papers.
    \end{experience}

    \begin{experience}{Georgia Tech Research Institute}{Atlanta, GA}{Research Intern}{June -- July 2020}
        \item Worked in a team of 4 to develop an app that creates a Bluetooth mesh network for emergency communication.
        \item Implemented routing algorithms in Python and Java and ran simulations of the app to investigate network properties and stability.
    \end{experience}
